*Just found an issue in OpenTX 2.2.0N363 for HORUS X12S / X9D and companion 2.2
On the Telemetry screen in HORUS X12S and companion the option FrSky D (Cable) is missing !

X9D+ and X9E are working properly.

This option is necessary for HORUS X12S and the MPX M-Link/FrSky telemetry converter to get the telemetry data into the HORUS X12S.
